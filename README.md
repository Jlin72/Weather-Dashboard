# Weather-Dashboard
The purpose of this repository is to store all the code requiered for the weather dashboard to work. This include javascript, css and html.

# Application link
This is the link for the deployed website: https://jlin72.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

# purpose
The purpose of this dashboard is to help an user of this application to look for the current and the next 5 days forecast of any city in the world. 

# How to use
In order to use this application the user only needs to type in the name of the city they want the forecast for on the search bar. Once the user is done, they simply have to press on the search button and the application will then proceed to display the weather forecast of the city that was typed inside the search bar. 

# Limitations
As of right now whenever the website starts it shows the weather forecast of Mississauga. In a near future, when the user opens the web application it will ask the user for their location and will then proceed to display the weather for their location.

One last thing that the weather app is lacking is the ability to record searches the user has done. Then from the recorded searches the user can click on them and get the forecast for the city they already searched for before.
